            Another place I would like to go is Taiwan.
            Taiwan is a vibrant island nation rich in diverse tourist attractions that cater to all types of travelers. 
            One of its most iconic spots is Taipei 101, once the tallest building in the world, offering stunning views of the city from its observation deck. 
            As a food lover, I am sure will go to the night markets, such as Shilin Night Market, offer a bustling atmosphere filled with unique shops and street food stalls, showcasing Taiwan's lively local culture.

            I often watch television programs or videos about Taiwan Cuisine. There are many foods recommended, and it also provides various food selections.
            I want to try the stinky tofu, an intense but delicious snack typically deep-fried and served with spicy sauce. Oyster omelets, made with fresh oysters and a unique batter, are another popular treat in night markets. 
            Additionally, bubble tea, invented in Taiwan, has become a global phenomenon, featuring chewy tapioca pearls and a variety of flavors. 
            Even though Malaysia has diverse bubble tea shops, I would like to compare them and know the differences.
